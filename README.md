# Unit testing with Jest
<!--endhide-->

> Important: 💻 This exercise is interactive. Please follow the instructions.

Most developers today are required not only to write code, but also need to write code to test their own code 😱, yes... really.

Today we are going to be using the [Jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) to create our first tests.

## 🌱 How to start this project

This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open:

```text
https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-unit-test-with-jest.git
```

**👉 Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).


> 💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

Then follow these instructions:

1. Get into the exercise folder: `$ cd exercise-unit-test-with-jest`
2. Download learnpack globally (if you don't have it already): `$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g`
3. Start the exercise: `$ learnpack start`

## What is this exercise about?

We are going to be using the Jest library to build a program capable of converting numeric values from one currency to another:

| Function name     | Description                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fromDollarToYen   | Receives a dollar amount and returns the equivalent amount in Japan Yen |
| fromEuroToDollar  | Receives a Euro amount and returns the equivalent amount in US Dollar |
| fromYenToPound    | Receives a Yen amount and returns the equivalent amount in England Pound |
