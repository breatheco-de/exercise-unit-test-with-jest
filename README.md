Most developers today are required not only to write code, but they also need to write code to test their own code 😱, yes.. really.

Today we are going to be using the [jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) to create our first tests.

## What is this exercise about?

We are going to be using the Jest library to build a program capable of converting numeric values from one currency to another:

| Function name     | Description                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
